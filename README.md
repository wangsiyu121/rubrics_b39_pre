## Issues
The main issues here would be the board set up. 
- The river looks in the wrong place, the soldiers should make one forward movement to be on the bank.
- Placement of red markers is not correct
- Gridlines should not show on the river
- The river should be a background fill in the middle of the board, between grid line, such that no markers would land on it.
- each side should have 5 ranks on each side of the river.
